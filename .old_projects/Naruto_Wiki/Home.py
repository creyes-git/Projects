The village was only saved from complete destruction by the actions of Konoha's leader, the Fourth Hokage, who sacrificed his life to 
seal the Nine-Tails into a newborn: Naruto Uzumaki. Orphaned by the attack, Naruto grew up shunned by most of the villagers, who hated 
and feared him because of the Nine-Tails trapped within him. Unaware of the monster he contained, Naruto longed for acknowledgment, 
and so vowed to one day become the greatest Hokage the village had ever seen.''')
