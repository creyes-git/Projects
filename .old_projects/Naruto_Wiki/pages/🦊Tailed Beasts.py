st.title("Tailed Beasts Characteristics")
st.markdown("Shukaku and the tailed beasts first came into being in the waning days of Hagoromo ≈åtsutsuki, who used his Creation of All Things Technique to divide the Ten-Tails' chakra into nine separate bodies and giving each a name. Some time after being created, the Sage explained to the young tailed beasts that a link existed between them despite their separation. He also foretold of a day when they would be brought together again - though not as they were - and that at that time someone would emerge to show them what true power is. In the anime, before his death, Hagoromo sent Shukaku to live in a temple built for the purpose of protecting it in a desert region that would later become part of the Land of Wind.")

st.title("Personality")
st.markdown("Shukaku is characterised as a childish and short-tempered individual, and often speaks in a bombastic and incoherent manner, giving it the demeanour of a drunkard. It uses ore-sama („Ç™„É¨Êßò, literally meaning: my esteemed self) when referring to itself, as it expresses great pride in its own abilities, especially its sealing techniques and defences. According to Gaara, prior to its introduction, Shukaku relishes the opportunity to kill anyone in sight, even more so during a full moon. Shukaku has also shown to harbour a bitter grudge towards Kurama due to the fox's beliefs that the tailed beasts' strength is measured by the number of tails, therefore viewing the tanuki as the weakest. Because of this, Shukaku strives to find any opportunity to surpass its arrogant rival.")
st.title("Abilities")
st.markdown("As a tailed beast, Shukaku possesses a large quantity of chakra and can perform the Tailed Beast Ball. As a precaution, if its jinch≈´riki lost control and fully transformed into Shukaku inside of Suna, the villagers were to either evacuate beforehand or seek shelter due to the risk of mass casualty from its rampage. Shukaku has the ability to control its jinch≈´riki whenever they sleep, leading its host to develop insomnia. Shukaku has great physical strength while using its tail, as seen when overlapping it with the other tailed beasts to shatter and even obliterate a senjutsu-enhanced humanoid Susanoo. Shukaku's power is quite impressive to the likes of the ≈åtsutsuki Clan, with Urashiki ≈åtsutsuki expressing glee in taking it.")
st.markdown('''Sand Manipulation: Shukaku enforcing a f≈´injutsu with its curse seal markings.
Shukaku's most notable ability is its sand manipulation, using it as an effective weapon and shield. Since its whole body is completely made of sand, the tanuki can ignore most damage that would otherwise be detrimental, as shown when it had one of its arms chopped off by Gamabunta and was still able to keep on fighting. Taking pride in its motto of absolute defence, Shukaku's sand is durable enough to block a senjutsu-enhanced Susanoo sword with ease. It is capable of performing f≈´injutsu by using its natural cursed seal markings across its own sand body, which gives off a magnetic field to bind its targets. One of its techniques, the Desert Layered Imperial Funeral Seal, is strong enough to temporarily restrain and withstand powerful techniques, like the Susanoo.
Nature Transformation: Shukaku can use Wind and Earth Release nature transformations. It can rapidly fire wind bullets with enough force to level entire forests. Likewise, it can combine its wind abilities with Gaara's sand in order to produce a mass of fast-moving sand bullets. He could also charge these wind bullets to the point they could fire like a Tailed Beast Ball, and wipe out entire landscapes.[28] Shukaku can combine wind and earth elements to use Magnet Release, and is the only tailed beast which can use cursed seals from its markings and infuse them into the Rasengan to create the Sage Art: Magnet Release Rasengan, which was powerful enough to restrain Madara Uchiha's shadow when he was the Ten-Tails' jinch≈´riki.''')

st.markdown("As a tailed beast, Matatabi has an enormous supply of chakra that it can transfer to others and can create the Tailed Beast Ball. As its appearance suggest, it can use Fire Release, which it can lend to its jinch≈´riki to create fireballs. Matatabi also has flexible muscles, which grant it great speed despite its large size. Matatabi's raw strength can easily crush an opponent or send them flying with one swipe of its paw. When combined with the other tailed beasts' tails, it could shatter and completely obliterate a senjutsu-enhanced complete Susanoo.")

It also has the ability to create coral and swim at very high speeds. Kirigakure was so confident of its destructive potential that they, under the influence of Madara Uchiha, intended to unleash Isobu in the midst of Konohagakure to destroy the village. In the anime, it could produce a hallucinogenic mist that exploited the victim's insecurities and forced the victim to face them.")
st.markdown('''Physical Prowess: Isobu can roll into a ball to move about quickly and attack its opponents, making full use of the protrusions on its shell in a manner similar to the Akimichi clans Spiked Human Bullet Tank. Isobu tough skin and shell also grant it additional defence, allowing it to withstand nearly all forms of attack. It can also use any of its three spiked tails to strike its opponents and break through most defences. In the anime, Isobu only known physical weakness is its eye; as tough as its skin and shell are, it cannot harden its eyes and thus seems to keep one closed at all times.''')
st.markdown('''Ninjutsu: In the anime, Isobu's abilities were greatly elaborated upon. It could create shockwaves to repel attacks and produce large tidal waves around it, enabling it to overwhelm Guren's Crystal Release several times over the course of their battle. When Isobu ate something, thousands of miniature versions of itself would attack what was eaten within its stomach, presumably to speed up the digestion process. It was also shown capable of Space-Time Ninjutsu, materialising an entrance to a separate dimension in which it could hide its presence, until it was ready to return to wherever it chooses.''')

It also hated humans, due to the fact that humans had enslaved it, and believes that apes are more intelligent than humans. However, when talking about the Sage of Six Paths, it showed him great respect, being that also had, apparently, a very deep relationship with him, never forgetting his final words. It also seems to have taken a liking to Naruto Uzumaki, as it was moved by his actions for truly trying to save it from being controlled by Tobi and even gave him some of its chakra before being sealed away. He also treats his fellow tailed beasts with much respect, as he addresses them by their name, as seen with Kurama. Son also has a high amount of respect for those who respect the tailed beasts.")

Though it does not speak much, Koku≈ç uses the rather old-fashioned watakushi (ÁßÅ) when referring to itself, causing it to come across as very polite. It also has pride as a tailed beast, being dismayed at being controlled and being used as Tobi's puppet during the Fourth Shinobi World War. After the end of the war, Koku≈ç declared that it wants to seclude itself in the forest, which implies it is a pacifistic individual, not wanting confrontations anymore.")

Koku≈ç also possesses great physical strength and uses its horns in combat, showing enough ramming-force to injure and knock Gy≈´ki a considerable distance away.")
st.markdown("Nature Transformation: By combining water and fire-natured chakra to create Boil Release, Koku≈ç is able to increase the temperature of its chakra to its boiling point. This ability forms the basis of what is referred to as steam-based ninjutsu, granting itself, or its jinch≈´riki, overwhelming physical strength.

In the anime, Saiken also seemed to be kinder and not as self-serving and malicious as most other tailed beasts, as when Utakata asked for its help to save Hotaru it seemed to willingly comply; and later it simply receded back into Utakata without trying to take him over. However, it was not above killing for self-preservation, as seen when it killed Harusame when he attempted to extract it from its jinch≈´riki. In the anime, it speaks with a high pitched voice and appears to be very energetic.''')

Gy≈´ki was also shown to have a good analytical ability, as it told Killer B that if he left Ponta and Sabu and ran away from them, Kisame Hoshigaki and his water dome would follow him and they (Sabu and Ponta) would be freed. Although Gy≈´ki mentioned that it and its brethren disliked Kurama for its arrogance and belief that their strength are based on their number of tails, it insisted that was no reason for not helping Naruto Uzumaki to control Kurama's power, hinting a benevolent side. Since then, both Gy≈´ki and B have taken a liking to Naruto.")

Even with only half its power, Kurama remained strong enough to defeat five other tailed beasts at the same time. After the Fourth Shinobi World War, Kurama's full power was restored once its two halves reunited inside Naruto, allowing it to defeat Toneri's giant golem and Momoshiki ≈åtsutsuki's elemental construct. The absolute peak of its power allowed it to even decisively overwhelm Isshiki ≈åtsutsuki. Kurama later became able to manifest itself outside of Naruto, allowing the two to fight independently and away from each other.")
st.markdown('''Chakra and Physical Prowess: Kurama possessed vast and powerful chakra, the most of the nine tailed beasts alongside Gy≈´ki, and was required to be sealed last into the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path to avoid overloading it. It could also accumulate a huge amount of chakra shortly after it has used up most of its own, enough to be passed on to the entire Allied Shinobi Forces and be felt countries away by non-sensors. Due to Naruto's compatibility with Kurama's chakra, any chakra it possessed is limited for its jinch≈´riki alone, unless it was moulded to fit the recipient's unique chakra signature. When used by others, the chakra became dense enough to be seen as a visible shroud than can further protect the wearer.
